## Summary
My project is a running log that I based off of Under Armor's MapMyRun app. The program prompts the user to log a run in the master loop, which the user can opt out by pressing q at the beggining of the prompt. The user then enters a value for the number of miles that they ran as well as the time it took in the form (hh:mm:ss). The program will relay this information back to the user and tell them their min/mi split and then repeat asking the user if they would like to input another run. The program keeps track of the current date so the weekly mileage total is tracked for that week. At the end of the week the program decides whether or not the user met the starting goal of 10 miles total that week. If they met this goal then the goal mileage will increase for the following week, if they did not meet this goal then the goal mileage will decrease for the following week.
